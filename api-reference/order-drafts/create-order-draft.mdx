title: Creating an order draft
description: Create an order draft

A new order draft is automatically created whenever a new conversation is created or when the previous order draft was registered/payed. In theory the Chatbot should never have to create the order draft. In case he needs to do so the following endpoint can be called. This completely overrides the previous order draft and associate the new order draft with the new Id to the conversation.
