This is by far the most important method and the one the whole chatbot logic rely on. This function takes properties to update on an order draft as an argument and output the updated order draft along with a validation object that shows errors that might have happened and that prevents the order draft to be registered, as well as key informations the chatbot can use to inform the customer (delivery address, discounts...)
