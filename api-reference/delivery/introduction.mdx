description: Introduction to the Delivery
---

Châtaigne allows its users to create and handle deliveries for orders that are going through our system. We integrate two third-party services available in Switzerland:

- Uber Direct
- Chaskis

The delivery goes through multiple status from the assignment of a driver to the completed delivery as well as failure states.

A delivery is created for every new order going through châtaigne.&#x20;

For orders coming from a third party channel, the restaurant is free to assign this delivery to a driver or to a third party service. The delivery object is then filled with informations computed from the assigned driver or from the third party service.

For orders coming from a châtaigne channel, we need to know the delivery service before hand in order to compute the estimate that is shown to the client. In this case the restaurant auto assign the order to a chosen delivery service in the parameters so that this service is used for all orders.
