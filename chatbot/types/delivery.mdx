description: Delivery-related data models for managing third-party delivery services, courier information, and delivery tracking
---

This module contains all delivery-related models used for managing deliveries through third-party providers like UberDirect and Chaskis.

<Note>
These delivery models are only present when delivery is handled by Ch√¢taigne through third-party providers. If an order has delivery service type but these objects are not present, it means the delivery is handled by the store's own delivery service.
