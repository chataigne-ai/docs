2. **Personalization**: Language preferences and delivery notes for customized service  
3. **Order History**: Access to previous orders for reordering and recommendations
4. **Memory Storage**: Persistent storage of customer preferences and special requirements
5. **Multi-location Support**: Tracking customer relationships across different restaurant locations

<Note>
Most customer fields are optional to accommodate different levels of customer information availability. The system can function with minimal customer data and progressively enhance the profile over time.
