The Business Organization type represents a multi-location business entity that can manage multiple restaurant locations under a single organization.

## Usage in Chatbot Payload

When the chatbot operates in business organization mode (`mode: "businessOrganization"`), the payload structure includes:

| Field                | Type                                                        | Description                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| mode                 | string                                                      | Set to "businessOrganization" for multi-location mode |
| businessOrganization | [Business Organization](#business-organization-object)      | The business organization data                        |
| location             | [Location](/chatbot/types/location/introduction) (optional) | The currently selected location (if any)              |

## Location Selection

In business organization mode:

- The chatbot starts without a selected location
- It can determine the appropriate location based on the customer's delivery address
- The `location` field in the payload is optional and only populated after a location is selected
- When updating an order draft, include the `locationId` parameter to specify which location to use

## Example

{
  "mode": "businessOrganization",
