This module contains all time and schedule-related models used for managing opening hours, time-based restrictions, and scheduling operations.

## Basic Time Models

### TimeDTO

| hour   | number | Yes      | Hour in 24-hour format (0-23) |
| minute | number | Yes      | Minutes (0-59)           |

**Examples:**
- `{ hour: 9, minute: 30 }` represents 9:30 AM
- `{ hour: 14, minute: 15 }` represents 2:15 PM
- `{ hour: 23, minute: 59 }` represents 11:59 PM

### DaysOfWeekDTO

Model for specifying which days of the week something applies to.

| Field     | Type    | Required | Description                    |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| monday    | boolean | Yes      | Whether Monday is included     |
| tuesday   | boolean | Yes      | Whether Tuesday is included    |

  "monday": true,
  "tuesday": true,
  "wednesday": true,
  "thursday": true,
  "friday": true,
  "saturday": false,
  "sunday": false
}
```
This represents weekdays only (Monday through Friday).

## Schedule Models

### TimeRangeDTO

Model for defining a time range within a day.

| Field | Type   | Required | Description                    |

**Examples:**
- `{ from: "09:00", to: "17:00" }` represents 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM

- `{ from: "18:30", to: "22:00" }` represents 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM

<Note>
Time ranges use 24-hour format strings for consistency and to avoid AM/PM confusion.
</Note>

### DayScheduleDTO

Model for defining operating hours for each day of the week.

| Field     | Type              | Required | Description                          |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| monday    | TimeRangeDTO[]    | No       | Monday operating time ranges         |
| tuesday   | TimeRangeDTO[]    | No       | Tuesday operating time ranges        |
| wednesday | TimeRangeDTO[]    | No       | Wednesday operating time ranges      |
| thursday  | TimeRangeDTO[]    | No       | Thursday operating time ranges       |
| friday    | TimeRangeDTO[]    | No       | Friday operating time ranges         |
| saturday  | TimeRangeDTO[]    | No       | Saturday operating time ranges       |
| sunday    | TimeRangeDTO[]    | No       | Sunday operating time ranges         |

**Features:**
- **Multiple Ranges**: Each day can have multiple time ranges (e.g., lunch and dinner service)
- **Closed Days**: Days with no time ranges are considered closed
- **Flexible Hours**: Different days can have completely different schedules

**Example:**
```json
{
  "monday": [
    { "from": "11:00", "to": "14:00" },
    { "from": "17:00", "to": "22:00" }
  ],
  "tuesday": [
    { "from": "11:00", "to": "14:00" },
    { "from": "17:00", "to": "22:00" }
  ],
  "wednesday": null,
  "thursday": [
    { "from": "11:00", "to": "22:00" }
  ]
}
```

This schedule shows:
- Monday & Tuesday: Open for lunch (11:00-14:00) and dinner (17:00-22:00)
- Wednesday: Closed
- Thursday: Open continuously (11:00-22:00)

## Operating Hours Models

### OpeningHoursDTO

Model for comprehensive operating hours with separate pickup and delivery schedules.

| Field    | Type            | Required | Description                          |
| -------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| pickup   | DayScheduleDTO  | No       | Pickup/collection operating hours    |
| delivery | DayScheduleDTO  | No       | Delivery service operating hours     |

**Use Cases:**

#### Separate Service Hours
Locations can have different hours for pickup and delivery:
- **Pickup**: When customers can collect orders in-store
- **Delivery**: When delivery service is available

#### Extended Delivery Hours  
Some locations offer delivery beyond their pickup hours:
```json
{
  "pickup": {
    "monday": [{ "from": "10:00", "to": "22:00" }]
  },
  "delivery": {
    "monday": [{ "from": "11:00", "to": "23:00" }]
  }
}
```

#### Limited Delivery Areas
Delivery might be available fewer days than pickup:
```json
{
  "pickup": {
    "monday": [{ "from": "09:00", "to": "20:00" }],
    "sunday": [{ "from": "12:00", "to": "18:00" }]
  },
  "delivery": {
    "monday": [{ "from": "11:00", "to": "19:00" }],
    "sunday": null
  }
}
```

## Preparation Time Models

### AveragePreparationTimeDTO

Model for average order preparation time.

| Field  | Type   | Required | Description                     |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| hour   | number | Yes      | Hours component (0-23)          |
| minute | number | Yes      | Minutes component (0-59)        |

**Examples:**
- `{ hour: 0, minute: 15 }` represents 15 minutes
- `{ hour: 0, minute: 30 }` represents 30 minutes  
- `{ hour: 1, minute: 0 }` represents 1 hour

**Usage:**
- **Order Timing**: Calculate when orders will be ready
- **Customer Expectations**: Inform customers of wait times
- **Capacity Planning**: Manage order scheduling
- **Delivery Estimates**: Factor into delivery time calculations

## Time-Based Operations

### Schedule Validation

The time models support various scheduling operations:

1. **Current Status**: Is the location currently open for pickup/delivery?
2. **Next Opening**: When will the location next be open?
3. **Service Availability**: Which services are currently available?
4. **Schedule Conflicts**: Are there any scheduling issues?

### Time Zone Considerations

All time schedules are interpreted in the location's local timezone:
- Locations specify their timezone in `LocationDTO`
- All time calculations use the location's timezone
- Customer communications show local times

### Holiday Handling

The schedule models can be extended for holiday operations:
- Special holiday hours can override regular schedules
- Closed days can be specified for holidays
- Limited service during holiday periods

### Business Rules

#### Minimum Operating Windows
- Each time range should have a reasonable duration
- Consider minimum preparation times
- Account for setup and cleanup time

#### Service Coordination
- Delivery hours should align with preparation capacity  
- Pickup hours should consider staff availability
- Multiple locations should coordinate for consistency

#### Customer Communication
- Clear indication when services are unavailable
- Advance notice of schedule changes
- Real-time status updates

<Note>
Time schedules are critical for customer experience and operational efficiency. They should be regularly reviewed and updated based on actual business operations.
