title: Getting started
description: This page and its subpages describe the chatbot integration and the different ways it interacts with the server.
---

The chatbot has two webhooks listening to events sent from the server:

<Card title="Message Webhook" href="/chatbot/message-webhook">
  Handle incoming messages received by the server and that needs the chatbot to
  take action
</Card>

<Card title="Event Webhook" href="/chatbot/event-webhook">
  Handle events received by the server and that might be interesting for the
  chabot. For example this could be an order status change or a successful
  payment.
</Card>

<Info>
  We might want to review the way we handle these as we scale as there might be
  quite a lot of events we would want to send the chatbot, each events being of
  different type
