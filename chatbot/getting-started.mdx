description: Quick intro to LeClerk, how it works, and where to find everything in the chatbot docs.

LeClerk is our AI-powered WhatsApp assistant for restaurants. It understands customer intent, calls backend tools (address check, order updates, etc.), and replies with friendly, contextual messages via WhatsApp.

### What you’ll learn here

- The high-level architecture and where LeClerk fits in the platform
- How customer messages and system events are processed
- The internal XML structure used to guide the LLM
- The tools the agent can call and when to use them
- The key flows: address validation, order-draft updates, multi‑location routing

### Start here (recommended path)

1. Read the overview to get the big picture

2. Understand how LeClerk is invoked
   - Message webhook (customer messages): [Message Webhook](/chatbot/message-webhook)
   - Event webhook (system events): [Event Webhook](/chatbot/event-webhook)
3. Learn how the LLM is steered
   - XML tags, parsing, guardrails: [Message Processing](/chatbot/message-processing)
4. See what the agent can do
   - Complete tool catalog and usage rules: [All Tools Reference](/chatbot/all-tools-reference)
5. Study the most important flows
   - Address validation and location selection: [Check Address](/chatbot/check-address)
   - Order building and validation pipeline: [Update Order Draft](/chatbot/update-order-draft)
   - Chain and location routing: [Multi‑location Management](/chatbot/multi-location-management)
6. Browse the data models
   - Catalog types (products, SKUs, options, deals): [Catalog Types](/chatbot/types/location/catalog)
7. Run useful local commands
   - Developer commands and utilities: [Commands](/chatbot/commands)

### How it works (in one minute)

- WhatsApp messages and system events hit the server; the server calls LeClerk via secured webhooks (Bearer token).
- LeClerk builds a prompt with context, lets the LLM decide, and executes safe tool calls when needed.
- Results are validated by the backend (business rules), then LeClerk sends a final response via the server to WhatsApp.
