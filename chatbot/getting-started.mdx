title: Getting started
description: This page and its subpages describe the chatbot integration and the different ways it interacts with the server.
---

The chatbot has two webhooks listening to events sent from the server:

- **Message webhook:** Handle incoming messages received by the server and that needs the chatbot to take action

[message-webhook.mdx](message-webhook.mdx)

- **Event webhook:** Handle events received by the server and that might be interesting for the chabot. For example this could be an order status change or a successful payment.

[event-webhook.mdx](event-webhook.mdx)

<Info>
  We might want to review the way we handle these as we scale as there might be
  quite a lot of events we would want to send the chatbot, each events being of
  different type
