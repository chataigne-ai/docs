description: Special commands available for debugging and testing the chatbot integration
---

The chatbot supports several special commands that can be sent via WhatsApp to perform administrative actions. These commands are primarily intended for debugging and testing purposes.

<Warning>
  These commands permanently delete data and should be used with caution. They
  are typically used during development and testing phases.
</Warning>

## Available Commands

### Reset Command

**Command:** `reset`

**Description:** Clears the chatbot's conversation memory by deleting all assistant messages from the current conversation.

**What it does:**

- Deletes all assistant messages associated with the conversation
- Preserves the customer data and conversation record
- Resets the chatbot's context, making it start fresh

**Use case:** When you want to reset the chatbot's memory of the conversation without affecting customer or conversation data.

```
reset
```

### Reset Conversation Command

**Command:** `reset-conversation`

**Description:** Completely deletes the entire conversation and all its related properties while preserving the customer data.

**What it does:**

- Deletes the conversation record entirely
- Removes all associated messages (both assistant and platform messages)
- Preserves the customer record and data
- Forces creation of a new conversation on next interaction

**Use case:** When you want to start completely fresh with a customer but keep their profile information.

```
reset-conversation
```

### Reset Customer Command

**Command:** `reset-customer`

**Description:** Completely removes the customer and all their associated data from the database.

**What it does:**

- Deletes all assistant messages from the conversation
- Completely removes the customer record
- Deletes all customer-related data (orders, conversations, etc.)
- Forces creation of a new customer record on next interaction

**Use case:** When you want to completely remove all traces of a customer from the system.

```
reset-customer
```

## Command Behavior

<Info>
  All commands are case-insensitive and should be sent as a regular text message
  via WhatsApp.
</Info>

### Processing Flow

1. The command is received through the Dialog webhook
2. The system identifies it as a special command
3. The appropriate action is executed immediately
4. The command processing stops (no response is sent to the chatbot)
5. No message is registered in the database for these commands

### Security Considerations

- Commands only work within the conversation context
- No authentication beyond the WhatsApp number association
- Commands cannot be executed by unauthorized users
- All command executions are logged for auditing purposes

## Implementation Details

These commands are handled in the `HandleDialogMessageUsecase` before any other message processing occurs. When a command is detected:

1. The system extracts the message content
2. Compares it against known commands (case-insensitive)
3. Executes the appropriate repository method
4. Returns early without further processing

The commands use the following repository methods:

- `reset`: `assistantMessageRepository.deleteAllAssistantMessages()`
- `reset-conversation`: `conversationRepository.deleteConversation()`
- `reset-customer`: `assistantMessageRepository.deleteAllAssistantMessages()` + `customerRepository.deleteCustomer()`
